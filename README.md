# Chess

This is a console chess game written in java.

* Removing pieces
* Moving pieces
* Castling
* En passant
* Checkmate and Checks
* Draws*

###### * We are missing one type of draw and that is the insufficient mating material draw, but we have decided that implementing that would be too complex

To play the game, simply run the program and then choose what  you want to do. configure the settings and then start playing!

To play the game, you need to input the location of the piece you are moving and the location you want to move to. For example, `e2 e4` to move the piece at e2 to e4.
